After 5 months, I still vividly remember my last day at Amazon. I knew very well from the week before what the outcome was and what would happen on that very last day. But I was just a navie kid (I still am), wishing on a shooting star. I cried as it happened ... 

Ending 2019 with all goals accomplished, I started 2020 with a complacent attitude and gradually lost momentum for work. My self-satisfaction "allows" me to become less and less disciplined, and my workstyle is getting closer to busts of energy when deadlines came rather than a systematic plan. The less disciplined I become, the more I felt bored with everything including myself. At one point, I had no plan whatsoever for myself and merely followed the school deadlines, did no workout, cooked inedible meal. I guess I lost the old me. But little did I imagine that 2020 would be such a hell of a roller-coaster ride. As I started my internship at Amazon with almost zero momentum, a rusty and sluggish brain, I tried to revived the 2019 me. Everything takes time, but the internship is a race against time. I had a terrible start: I took too long to ramp up for the project and made some silly mistakes here and there. I'm still embrassed thinking back of that time. It wasn't until the 8th week that the old me was back, and that was definitely too late to turn things around. Consequently, no matter how much more hours I put into work, I couldn't compensate for what was lost in the first 7 weeks. I was stressed as I was angry at myself at how things happened. I couldn't understand how I could let the first few months of the year went by without any meaningful work. The stress turned me into a jerk at home, and I became an annoying kid and frequently got mad at my cousin. Even after a few weeks later, I still couldn't even sleep without reflecting on what's got into me. Misfortune comes hand in hand with opportunites. There are two invaluable presents that the internship gave me: one is to always have a working plan for every day, two is the determination to improve myself.

I suffered from a mild burnout and imposter symdrome after the internship. I felt like I had no skill and was totally a fraud. Since then, I have a self-reflection on myself everyday. During my journey, I was lucky but never without lots of effort. Our own effort creates luck for ourself. I was hungry more than ever after the internship and couldn't accept to be like at a low point like that. I started a plan of 4 weeks to polish the rusty skills. I didn't start my job finding journey until late September - early October 2020. One of the trickiest part of finding tech job is the tech interview. I hadn't done one leetcode question until I started applying for jobs, and thus, my leetcode problem solving skill also became kinda rusty. I started working on one problem everyday, then two problems everyday. But as I became busier later in the semester, I couldn't maintain the same progress. Luckily, my childhood friend, who is an MIT student also applied for job and helped me with mock interview. She is a person with tremendous positivity and a great sense of humor, and after every mock interview section with her, I felt more and more motivated. I landed interviews at several good companies thanks to having Amazon on my resume. The first final on-site I got to was with Microsoft. In one round of the on-site, I had one leetcode question that I wasn't quite familiar with, and I did horribly. Inevitably, having one "No" is enough to reject me. I was disappointed, but thankfully, the built-up momentum didn't let me stuck on it. There is a pattern that I found in any interview that I failed: I always tried to recall from memory the data structure or the algorithms that can be applied rather than focusing on the problem at hand. Why don't I change the strategy and just focus 100% on the problem? Let's clear my mind and not recall or memorize anything. Let's just look at the problem with a fresh mind and try to solve it without any memorization. I applied this new strategy on a phone interview a week after: I again got a quetion I never had before but was able to got to the optimal solution. Short long story, I finally land an offer at Apple. I was so thrilled on that day, as I thought there were a few points I could have done better, but finally, I passed the intense Apple on-site..

2020 is a year of self-reflection for all of us. Covid-19, other issues in the world (BLM and Presidential Election in the US, flood in Central Vietnam - where my hometown is) all have deep-rooted causes, but we were all too busy to fix them until they burst. Hopefully, these lessons would lead to better versions of all us in the future. 

It was very late when I finished this blog. I had plan for this blog way back in late 2020 but didn't know how to start. Thankfully, I got emotional when listenning to an old song on the radio and started writng. My writing has become awkward after a long time not writing any blog, but I still need to write this, because my year of 2020 wouldn't completed without this blog. For many years later, I will reread this blog to remind me to keep pushing forward and never ever settle!  

Special thanks to my family and relatives, my friends and colleagues. Thank you for being with me in this journey. Without you, the amazing 2020 would never happen!
