Random fun facts:
* I'm a first generation college graduate 
* I changed my major three times in college (Statistics -> Mathematics and Economics -> Mathematics)
* I have two middle names
### Interest
Iâ€™m interested in but realistically not getting back onto the machine learning hype train. I worked on a project about neural network compression techniques at UMass Amherst. 

I'm now exploring domains in software engineering: big data, distributed system. 

### Hobbies
I used to watch a lot of movies but essientially put a strict limit on that.

My favorite football (soccer) team is Chelsea F.C. 

Recently, I get to enjoy cooking, I either improvise recipe or spend hours browsing recipes from the internet. 

I'm a practioner of [The Plum Village Tradition](https://plumvillage.org).
